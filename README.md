# c-code-compiler
Details: Designed and implemented a web-based C programming environment
that enables users to write, correct, compile, and execute C code directly in the
browser. Integrated a fine-tuned CodeT5 model for automatic syntax error
correction and a custom LLVM-based compilation pipeline that performs
function-level partitioning and object file caching. Developed the frontend using
Django templates with CSS styling and enabled live output execution using
Pythonâ€™s subprocess module. The system highlights syntax fixes and displays
compilation or runtime output seamlessly, making it both educational and
developer-friendly.
